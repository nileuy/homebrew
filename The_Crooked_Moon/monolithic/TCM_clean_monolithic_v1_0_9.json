A target can be a creature or a nonmagical plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree or shrub. In either case, each can be targeted by only one of the tendrils. A target that is a creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d8 Necrotic damage and has the Poisoned condition for the duration.
