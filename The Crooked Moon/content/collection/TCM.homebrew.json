An elegant outfit of diamond\nmotley with a painted mask—performs dances, gives eloquent speeches, and plays tricks\n2 The Jester.

A vibrant, colorful suit with wild hair and bowler hat—favors silly jokes, slapstick comedy, and clumsy self-deprecation\n4 The Mime. A striped, black-and-white shirt with a flat cap and red suspenders—pantomimes comical scenarios without speaking\n5 The Sad Clown. A monochromatic, one-piece outfit with pointed hat and puffball buttons—utilizes melodramatic melancholy and song\n6 The Tramp. A patch-covered coat, tattered scarf,\nscuffed shoes, and cigar—leverages sardonic wit,\ninsults, and mocking observations"
