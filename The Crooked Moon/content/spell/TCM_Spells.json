The target, or another creature within reach of the target, can take an action to allow the target to repeat the saving throw, ending the spell on a success. A creature killed by the damage from this spell is reduced to ash, along with any nonmagical equipment it is wearing or carrying."

Three tendrils then leap from that target to as many as three other targets of your choice, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature or a nonmagical plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree or shrub. In either case, each can be targeted by only one of the tendrils. A target that is a creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d8 Necrotic damage and has the Poisoned condition for the duration. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only. A creature Poisoned in this way takes 1d8 Necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. A Poisoned creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on itself on a success. A Plant creature automatically fails the initial save, and a nonmagical plant that isn’t a creature simply withers and dies."
