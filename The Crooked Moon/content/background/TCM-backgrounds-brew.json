        "Some portion of your past has been swallowed by\nnothingness. The missing time could be a short\ninterval—mere days or weeks gone from your memory—\nor you might have only vague hints at best of who you are and where you are from. Flashes of déjà vu\nare common, taunting you with recollection, but they\nalmost always slip away, as ungraspable as the mists of\nDruskenvald. An injury, some traumatic experience, or\nthe magical workings of a spell or curse could be the culprit behind your amnesia.\nF\nEa t: Memory Starved (see page 115)\nsk ill Pro F ici Enc i E s: Choose two (see below)\nto ol Pro F ici Enc y: Choose one (see below)\nEqui PmEnt: Choose A or B: (A) Book (personal notes),\nInk, Ink Pen, Traveler’s Clothes, 11 GP; or (B) 50 GP\nSCATTERED MEMORIES\nYou don’t choose skill proficiencies or a tool proficiency\nwhen you select this background, and you don't\ndetermine the two languages that are part of your\norigin—these are parts of your past that you are missing. Instead, you can pick one of those proficiencies or the\nlanguages during play at any time. The knowledge might\nreturn in a spontaneous flash, even as you make a roll\nthat relies on the proficiency, or slowly emerge as you\nstruggle to solve a problem. Once you choose one of these features, you can’t choose another one until you\ngain a level.\nThe GM might rule that you can choose a new\nrecalled feature early if something reminds you of your past, such as finding a piece of evidence from your\nmissing memories or experiencing an event similar\nto one you have forgotten. Of particular value is an\nevent relating to one of the story threads or trinkets presented below.\nBUILDING AN AMNESIAC\nAny character can face misfortune or a choice that steals their memory. Consider how your character came to\nlose their memory. Was it lost through injury or illness,\nor did something more sinister steal it with a toxin or curse? You might decide to leave this choice up to the\nGM, letting you as a player discover the cause alongside\nyour character.\nSuggested Story Threads. This background presents\na paradox when considering threads to weave through\na campaign, since the character may not remember\nthem. Work with the GM to create some leading events or people that can serve as constants to trace a path through the void of the character’s past, especially if the GM can insert existing nonplayer characters into the\nthread to strengthen these connections. The Amnesiac\nStory Threads table suggests events and people who can be the start of these threads.\nAmnesiac Story Threads\n1d6 Thread\n1 You have recurring dreams of someone you\nmight recognize on your adventures.\n2 You absent-mindedly doodle the same design or\nsymbol over and over.\n3 A friend has been traveling the provinces of\nDruskenvald with a caravan, searching for any\nhint of your past as they do.\n4 A rhyme or song you’ve never heard before\ncomes to mind when your thoughts wander.\n5 Rainbow colors, such as those on a soap bubble\nor oil slick, fill you with unexplained terror.\n6 You have a fragmented recollection of traveling to\na remote place in the mountains.\nAmnesiac Trinkets.

Not all who come to the wicker\ncraft do so with noble intent—some, broken by spite and\ntwisted by their pain, wield the power of the wicker into\nmalicious revenge, lashing out with curses bound in twig and bone and inflicting the wrath of the forest upon\nthose who wronged them.\nSuggested Story Threads.
